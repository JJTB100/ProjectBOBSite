<p>Week 0: We booked the interview slot as well as wrote up interview questions. Furthermore we researched Java frameworks as well as researching software methodologies. 
We also started writing up the planning document. </p>

<p>Week 1: We wrote about the requirements as well as started thinking about the art style and story line of the game. This was only possible due to the fact that we have had our interview and gathered the stakeholders requirements through it.</p>

<p>Week 2: Unfortunately for this week we could not move onto programming and thus the programming of the game will be the key issue to address during week 3. However, the UML diagrams were made and a succinct architecture was also created. </p>
